# Judify - Student Profile Implementation

## Recent Changes

We've implemented the Student Profile functionality that was missing from the backend. The following components were added:

### Backend (Java)

1. **Entity**: `StudentProfileEntity` in `backend/src/main/java/edu/cit/Judify/StudentProfile/`
2. **DTOs**: 
   - `StudentProfileDTO`
   - `LocationDTO`
   - `CreateStudentProfileRequest`
3. **Repository**: `StudentProfileRepository` 
4. **Service**: `StudentProfileService`
5. **Controller**: `StudentProfileController` - Provides the API endpoints required by the frontend

### API Endpoints

The following API endpoints were added to match the frontend expectations:

- `GET /api/student-profiles/{id}` - Get a student profile by ID
- `GET /api/student-profiles/user/{userId}` - Get a student profile by user ID
- `POST /api/student-profiles` - Create a new student profile
- `PUT /api/student-profiles/{userId}` - Update an existing student profile
- `DELETE /api/student-profiles/{id}` - Delete a student profile

## How to Test

1. Set up environment variables:
   
   **Frontend (.env.local in frontend_web directory):**
   ```
   # OAuth Credentials
   VITE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_oauth_client_id_here
   VITE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_oauth_client_secret_here

   # API URLs
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
   VITE_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:8080/auth

   # Environment
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```
   
   **Backend (application.properties in backend/src/main/resources):**
   ```
   # OAuth Configuration
   spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-id=your_google_client_id
   spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-secret=your_google_client_secret
   
   # Other OAuth configurations as needed
   ```

2. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd backend
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

3. Start the frontend development server:
   ```
   cd frontend_web
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Log in to the application and go to the Student Profile page
5. You should now be able to create, view, and update your student profile

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues with the student profile page:

1. Check the browser console for any error messages
2. Verify that the backend server is running correctly
3. Ensure that the database schema is updated with the new student_profiles table
4. Check that your user account is properly authenticated
