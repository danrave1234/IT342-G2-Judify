### SYSTEM NAME: 
JUDIFY

### PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:
Judify is a hybrid online/offline tutoring platform that connects students with tutors through GPS-based location matching or remote sessions. The system integrates web and mobile applications to enable real-time video calls, chat, document sharing, and hourly billing. Tutors can offer in-person meetings (tracked via GPS) or virtual sessions, while students search, book, and rate tutors based on expertise, availability, and reviews. The platform automates payment processing, session scheduling, and progress tracking, leveraging APIs like Google Maps for location services, Stripe for payments, and Jitsi Meet/Zoom for video conferencing.
