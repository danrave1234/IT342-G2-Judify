<h1>ðŸš€ Development Progress & Issue Tracking ðŸš€</h1>
<p>This document tracks major issues fixed and improvements made to the Judify frontend application.</p>
</div>

## Purpose

This PROGRESS.md file serves as a historical record of significant issues that have been addressed in the frontend application. It helps developers understand:

- What major problems were encountered
- How they were resolved
- Which components were affected
- When the fixes were implemented

This document should be updated whenever major components are modified or significant issues are fixed.

## Major Issues Fixed

### 1. Session Booking Redirection Issue (April 2025)

**Problem:**
When users clicked on the "View Profile and Book Session" button on a tutor's profile, they were redirected to an empty page displaying "Tutor Not Found" instead of the Session Scheduling Page.

**Root Cause:**
The BookSession.jsx component was making direct fetch calls with potentially incorrect URLs, causing the "Tutor Not Found" error. Additionally, there were issues with the authentication context in the BookSession component.

**Solution:**
- Updated the BookSession.jsx component to use the API instance from api.js instead of making direct fetch calls
- Fixed the authentication context by replacing useAuth with useUser from UserContext
- Updated all references to currentUser to use user instead
- Improved error handling and added fallback mechanisms when tutor data cannot be retrieved

**Affected Components:**
- `src/pages/student/BookSession.jsx`
- `src/pages/student/FindTutors.jsx`
- `src/pages/student/TutorDetails.jsx`

**Impact:**
Students can now successfully view tutor profiles and book sessions, with the system properly syncing with Google Calendar and sending confirmation emails.

### 2. Calendar Integration Improvements (March 2025)

**Problem:**
The calendar integration for scheduled sessions was not working correctly. When sessions were booked, the calendar invitations were either not being generated or contained incorrect information.

**Root Cause:**
The CalendarService.java component had issues with formatting the iCalendar (.ics) files, and the EmailService was not properly attaching these files to confirmation emails.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced the CalendarService to properly generate iCalendar files with all required session details
- Improved the EmailService to correctly attach calendar files to confirmation emails
- Added proper formatting for event details including subject, start time, end time, location, meeting link, and notes
- Implemented reminder notifications set for 15 minutes before sessions

**Affected Components:**
- Backend: `CalendarService.java`
- Backend: `EmailService.java`
- Frontend: `src/context/SessionContext.jsx`

**Impact:**
The system now successfully generates calendar invitations that can be added to Google Calendar and other calendar applications, improving session attendance and reducing scheduling conflicts.

### 3. Authentication Context Issues (February 2025)

**Problem:**
Several components were experiencing authentication-related errors, particularly when trying to access user information. Console errors showed "Cannot destructure property 'currentUser' of 'useAuth(...)' as it is undefined."

**Root Cause:**
The application was using two different authentication contexts (AuthContext and UserContext) inconsistently across components, leading to undefined values when trying to access user data.

**Solution:**
- Standardized the use of UserContext across all components
- Replaced useAuth() with useUser() in components that were still using the old context
- Updated references from currentUser to user to match the UserContext structure
- Added better error handling for cases where user data might be undefined

**Affected Components:**
- `src/pages/student/BookSession.jsx`
- `src/pages/student/TutorDetails.jsx`
- Several other components that were using authentication

**Impact:**
Components now consistently access user information, eliminating authentication-related errors and providing a more stable user experience.

### 4. API Import Error in BookSession Component (April 2025)

**Problem:**
When running the application, an error occurred: "BookSession.jsx:6 Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/api/api.js' does not provide an export named 'API'". This prevented the BookSession component from loading properly.

**Root Cause:**
The BookSession.jsx component was trying to import the API object as a named export from api.js, but api.js was exporting it as a default export.

**Solution:**
- Updated the import statement in BookSession.jsx to correctly import API as a default export
- Changed from `import { tutorProfileApi, tutorAvailabilityApi, API } from '../../api/api';` to:
  ```javascript
  import { tutorProfileApi, tutorAvailabilityApi } from '../../api/api';
  import API from '../../api/api';
  ```

**Affected Components:**
- `src/pages/student/BookSession.jsx`

**Impact:**
The BookSession component now loads correctly without any import errors, allowing students to book sessions with tutors.

## Ongoing Improvements

### Student Profile Management

We're continuing to enhance the student profile management functionality:

- Adding more fields for learning preferences
- Implementing better location-based tutor matching
- Improving the profile completion workflow

### Session Scheduling & Calendar Integration (April 2025)

**Problem:**
The session booking calendar didn't properly integrate with Google Calendar and didn't show time slots in 30-minute intervals based on the tutor's availability. Tutors had no way to sync their availability with their Google Calendar.

**Root Cause:**
The time slot generation logic in BookSession.jsx only used the tutor's recurring availability from the database and didn't check against the tutor's Google Calendar for conflicts. There was no real-time integration with Google Calendar, and the system was using a mock implementation that didn't reflect actual calendar events.

**Solution:**
- Created a comprehensive Google Calendar integration in the backend with proper authentication and API endpoints
- Implemented a new GoogleCalendarService class to handle all Google Calendar operations
- Added a GoogleCalendarController to expose the service methods as REST endpoints
- Enhanced the TutorAvailability component to allow tutors to connect their Google Calendar and view conflicts
- Updated the BookSession component to check real-time availability against the tutor's Google Calendar
- Modified the booking process to create events in Google Calendar when sessions are booked
- Improved error handling to ensure the booking process continues even if Google Calendar integration fails

**Affected Components:**
- Backend: `GoogleCalendarService.java` (new)
- Backend: `GoogleCalendarController.java` (new)
- Frontend: `src/pages/tutor/Availability.jsx`
- Frontend: `src/pages/student/BookSession.jsx`

**Impact:**
Students can now see truly available time slots that respect both the tutor's set availability and their Google Calendar events. Tutors can connect their Google Calendar to avoid scheduling conflicts, and booked sessions are automatically added to the tutor's calendar. This creates a seamless scheduling experience that reduces double-bookings and improves session attendance.

### Future Session Scheduling Enhancements

Planned improvements to the session scheduling system:

- Real-time availability updates using WebSockets
- More flexible scheduling options (recurring sessions, session packages)
- Enhanced calendar integration with additional reminder options
